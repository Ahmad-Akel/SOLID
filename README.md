# SOLID

`Quick explanation of SOLID principles with Java programming language`
------
In Java, [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID
) principles are an object-oriented approach that are applied to software structure design. It is conceptualized by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) (also known as Uncle Bob). These five principles have changed the world of object-oriented programming, and also changed the way of writing software. It also ensures that the software is modular, easy to understand, debug, and refactor. In this section, we will discuss SOLID principles in Java with proper example.

Why SOLID?
------

Basicly using SOLID as a Design Principles and Design Patterns it will help us on writing better code which will lead us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software, Consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches further down the road!

SOLID principles concepts:
------
1-Single Responsibility

2-Open/Closed

3-Liskov Substitution

4-Interface Segregation

5-Dependency Inversion

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's discuss each of them separately, giving code examples  

1-Single Responsibility
------
Single Responsiblity Principle or (SRP) means that each class should have a specific functionality or responsibility in order to facilitate modification and addition to the code in the future.
If one class has multiple uses and responsibilities, this will lead to changing the whole class in order to change one feature of the class, but by using the single responsibility principle, we can separate the class functionalities into many separate classes to fulfill the goal of the principle.

For example:

2-Open/Closed

3-Liskov Substitution
